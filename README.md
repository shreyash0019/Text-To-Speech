# Text-To-Speech

This project converts text from a file (`abc.txt`) into speech, saves it as an MP3 file, and plays the MP3 file on your device.

## Prerequisites

- **abc.txt**: A text file containing the text you want to convert to speech.
- **gTTS==2.1.1** module: Install using `pip install gTTS`.
- **os** module: This module comes pre-installed with Python, no need to install separately.

## Installation

2. Install the `gTTS` module by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install gTTS
